# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.
#
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace ":80" below with your
# domain name.

cxyds.top, www.cxyds.top {
	# Set this path to your site's directory.
	# root * /var/www/cxyds.top/

	# Enable the static file server.
	file_server

	# Another common task is to set up a reverse proxy:
	# reverse_proxy localhost:8080
	reverse_proxy https://hk.cxyds.top {
		header_up Host {http.reverse_proxy.upstream.hostport}
	}


	# Or serve a PHP site through php-fpm:
	# php_fastcgi localhost:9000

	log {
		level debug
		output file /var/log/caddy/access.log
	}
}

staging.cxyds.top {
	reverse_proxy /* https://staging-hk.cxyds.top {
		header_up Host {http.reverse_proxy.upstream.hostport}
	}
}

prod.cxyds.top {
        reverse_proxy https://prod-hk.cxyds.top {
                header_up Host {http.reverse_proxy.upstream.hostport}
        }
}
